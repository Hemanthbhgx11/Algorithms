BFS and DFS Algorithms Notebook
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating core concepts and Python implementations of Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS). Example graphs use Indian city names such as Hyderabad, Chennai, Mumbai, and Pune.

📄 Contents
Theory and Explanation:

Overview of BFS and DFS algorithms

Data structures (Queue for BFS, Stack/Recursion for DFS)
